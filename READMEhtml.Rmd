The goal of clust431 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of clust431 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("clust431")
```

## em_clust() code example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(clust431)
library(dplyr)
## iris2 <- iris %>% select(-Species)
## em_clust(iris2,2)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
iris2 <- iris %>% select(-Species)
#em_clust(iris2,2)
```
I wasn't able to figure the code out for this submission.
